# Pomodoro: The Turn Based RPG!

## A fun take on the **[Pomodoro Technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique)**

#### So, what does this application *do?*

> This application utilizes the famous Pomodoro Technique and turns it into something fun rather than a mere timer.
> Players can set the Pomodoro style of their choice (consisting of various focus periods and break lengths), and work
> on their tasks until it goes off. Once the task is complete, they will gain a specific amount of XP in accordance to
> their level, which allows players to level up, learn new skills, and earn new items. Furthermore, they can choose to
> battle in the dungeon during or after their break, encountering new enemies and bosses along the way. Defeating
> enemies can result in XP gain, loot drops, and money, which can be used to buy items from the shopkeeper. All of these
> features allow for a fun experience while motivating the player to complete real life tasks in order to get further
> into the dungeon and beat the game.
> > *The dungeon calls for a great warrior up to the task...*

#### What audience does this application target? 

> This application is meant for people who struggle to be productive because working/studying is *boring*. No one wants
> to complete all their work just for there to be no reward at the end. This app attempts to make the user feel rewarded
> when they complete tasks so that they can feel motivated to do more work. This is known as **positive reinforcement,** 
> a popular concept in psychology. While this application may resonate more strongly with individuals familiar with RPG
> video games, it can be picked up and enjoyed by anyone. 

#### Why am I interested in making this application?

> Throughout my entire life, I have played video games as a hobby. I love the fact that I can boot up a game and get 
> immersed in a virtual world, alleviating the stress of my everyday life. Video games have always been very therapeutic 
> to me, and is the reason why myself and many others love playing games. Furthermore, I've always been very interested 
> in making my own game. I am hoping that creating this application can give me insight on some design aspects required 
> to make an RPG, while also being a project that genuinely seems fun to create.
